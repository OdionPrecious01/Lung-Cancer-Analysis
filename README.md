# Lung-Cancer-Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive lung cancer risk analysis based on 50,000 patient records. It includes the raw dataset, analyzed data, Excel visualizations, and a detailed technical report examining the impact of smoking history (pack years) and environmental exposures such as radon and asbestos on lung cancer incidence.

Using a dataset of 50,000 patient records, the project quantifies the impact of pack years, radon exposure, and asbestos exposure on lung cancer risk, with the goal of supporting evidence-based clinical screening and public health decision-making.

The analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel, emphasizing clarity, interpretability, and real-world healthcare relevance.

Project Objectives
- Quantify lung cancer incidence across key risk factors
- Compare the relative impact of smoking history versus environmental exposure
- Identify high-risk patient groups for targeted screening
- Translate analytical findings into actionable clinical and public health insights

Repository Contents
- Raw Data – Original lung cancer risk factor dataset
- Analyzed Data – Cleaned and transformed data used for analysis
- Excel Dashboard & Charts – Visual summaries of key findings

Technical Report – Detailed report covering:
- Story of Data
- Data Cleaning, Transformation, and Splitting
- Pre-Analysis, In-Analysis, and Post-Analysis
- Visualizations, Insights, and Recommendations
- Tools & Methods
- Microsoft Excel
- Data cleaning and validation
- Pivot Tables and cross-tabulation
- Grouping and binning (Age, Pack Years)
- Incidence rate calculations
- Data visualization and dashboard design

Key Insights
- Environmental exposure (radon and asbestos) drives a disproportionately higher increase in lung cancer incidence compared to baseline risk
- High pack-year smoking histories create the largest pool of at-risk patients
- Lung cancer incidence exceeds 76% among patients exposed to high radon or asbestos
- Age, gender, and alcohol consumption show relatively uniform distributions, reinforcing exposure and smoking history as primary risk drivers

Use Cases

- Healthcare and public health analytics portfolios
- Epidemiological risk analysis demonstrations
- Excel-based data analytics projects
- Academic, internship, or recruiter review
